# TextExtraction_from_multimedia
ABSTRACT:

Text extraction is one of the key tasks in document image analysis. Automatic text extraction without characters recognition capabilities is to extract regions just contains text. The text extraction process includes detection, localization, segmentation and enhancement of the text from the given input image. In this paper we present a comparative study and performance evaluation of various text extraction techniques. 
Key words: Text Detection, Text Extraction, QR generation , Speech to text. 

INTRODUCTION:

Text extraction from an image is a challenging problem because of image contains text due to different size, style, orientation, alignment, low contrast, noise and has complex background structure. This extracted text contains only black text in white background, i.e. it can be recognized by any recognition system. Extracting text from an image or video includes in different applications like document processing, image indexing, video content summary, video retrieval, video understanding etc
